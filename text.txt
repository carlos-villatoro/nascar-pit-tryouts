## MVP


* Create a cursor controlled game
* Create a landing page with a start and restart button
* Create a canvas area to play the game in
* Change cursor within game area to impact gun
* Create mouse events for clicking lug nuts
* Start timer upon first mouse click
* Have lug nuts move when clicked
* Create a random render after each lug nut has been removed
* Have hitboxes that lug nuts need to be clicked on
* Stop timer when all lug nuts are back on wheel
* Create a win event if timer is not 0:00, record time task was completed in
* Create a lose even if timer reaches 0:00 before player completes task
* Restart button should reset game


## Stretch Goals


* Have different difficulty levels, causing timer to be faster
* Have game be multi-player
    * Each persons time gets saved - if they beat the clock
    * Have leaderboard of times (including DNFs)
* Animate wheel to move out and into game area 1
* Add sound to the click and hold

## Forseeable Roadblacks

* Creating lug nut object hitboxes and wheel hitboxes for each lugnut
* Getting correct combination of mouse events 
* Having game stop and not be playable upon lose - timer runs out
* Having lug nuts not fall outside of the random field
