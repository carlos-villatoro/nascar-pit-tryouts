# NASCAR™ Pit Tryouts

## Lets get luggin ...
___

### You feel the roars of the engines. You smell the burning of the tires. Your andreline is kicking. You've been a NASCAR™ fan since you could sit in the stands and now you're in the pits. 

### Today you will be trying out to be a pit stop tire changer. You've been practicing the moves for weeks and today you will be picking up an impact gun and kicking some nuts loose!

### But if you can't beat the clock, you won't be suiting up for a raceday any time soon. Your job is to loosen every lug nut off the car's' wheel, pickup the the fallen lug nuts, zap them back onto the wheel ... __all before the clock reaches 0!__
